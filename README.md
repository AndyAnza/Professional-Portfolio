# My-Professional-Portfolio

## Description
This site was made to show future projects that will be part of my portfolio so that hiring managers can know more about me and my work. 
The web application is divided into different sections:

 - Header navigation bar: My name and links to the corresponding sections are found here.
 - Main image: Here you'll find a banner with cool pixel art. You'll also find my profile pic and a friendly greeting.
 - About me: Short paragraph about myself.
 - Work: Here you will find five sections with images that by clicking them will take you for now to Google, but in the future it will lead to my own projects.
 - Footer navigation bar: Here you'll find my contact info like my phone, mail, and links that will lead you to my github page, my twitter and even my spotify where you will find cool playlist that I've made.
 
 ## Technical
- Pseudo-classes were implemented. All links of the footer and header will change color to green by hovering over them, and will change to hotpink once you click on them.
- Project images borders and titles will also change to hotpink if you hover over them. The opacity of the image will also change.
- To create all the different sections of the web application I used Flexbox,creating rows to divide the aside section and the main section where all my projects were displayed.
- Added links that will scroll to the UI corresponding section.
- Created a bigger image/section for the main project.
- Added media queries that works for devices with screens of 780px and 480px.
- My Last Name at the top of the Page is shown by using Pseudo-elements.
- Alt attributes are found in each of the images used on the site.
